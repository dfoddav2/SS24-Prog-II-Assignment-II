# Backend for assignment 2 of Programming II SS2024

The backend can be run seperately from the from the frontend, so that is what I am documenting here.

## How to run

1. Open the directory of the backend project
2. Run `docker compose up -d` to start the `MongoDB` database
3. Run `python start.py` to start the Flask server application

## How to test

1. Open the directory of the backend project
2. Run `docker compose up -d` to start the `MongoDB` database
3. Run `pytest` simply by itself
